DPLL Algorithm

TODO: - currently will always return an assignment mapping
            regardless of whether or not the mapping actually satisfies
            the CNF
      - only returns True assignments, False assignments left out of map

USAGE: - no main, so through ghci
       - :l Sat
       - working example: dpll (CNF [[1], [2, -1]])
       - broken example: dpll (CNF [[1], [2, -1], [-1]])
       - input assumed to already be in CNF
             CNF [[1], [2, -1]] is A ^ (B v ~A)
